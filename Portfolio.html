            As we know web design is the process of creating and developing websites.<br>
            The main way of creating websites is building it from scratch using HTML language.<br>
            First of all. Creating web page is not that so difficult. <br>
            Iâ€™ve known how to create and design a webpage for only about a month now, and I have struggled with it the entire way. <br>
            Right now i am feeling that i have learned some of css and html fundamental's.<br>
